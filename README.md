##Attendance Management System
#Overview
This web application serves as an Attendance Management System for tracking and managing student attendance in a classroom setting. It includes features for recording attendance, generating attendance reports, and capturing a screenshot of the application.

##Usage:
#Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.

#Bash

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/attendance-management-system.git
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

##Features
#1. Date Selection
The user can select the date for which attendance needs to be recorded.

#2. Course and Section Selection
Choose the course and section for which you want to manage attendance.

#3. Attendance Status
The application dynamically generates a table with student names and dropdowns to mark their attendance status as present or absent.

#4. Review Report
Clicking on the "Review Report" button validates the entries and displays a summary of the selected date, course, section, and attendance status for each student.

#5. Take a Snap
The "Take a Snap" button captures a screenshot of the entire application using the HTML2Canvas library and downloads it as an image file.

##How It Works
#Initialization
The application initializes with the current date and generates the initial attendance table with student names.

#Attendance Table Generation:
The generateAttendanceTable function dynamically creates a table with student names and dropdowns for marking attendance.

#Attendance Validation:
The validateAndGeneratePDF function ensures that all required fields are filled and prompts the user to mark attendance for all students before generating a report.

#PDF Generation:
The generatePDF function collects the selected date, course, section, and attendance status, then displays a placeholder message. Integration with an actual PDF generation library can be implemented.

#Screenshot Capture:
The takeScreenshot function utilizes the HTML2Canvas library to capture a screenshot of the entire application and provides a download link for the image.

##Dependencies
#HTML2Canvas:
Used for capturing screenshots.
